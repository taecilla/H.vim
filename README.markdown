(Very) small Vim plug-in that adds two commands related to
`:help`:

1. `:H` opens the help in a vertical window. It works the same way
as `:vertical help`, but it also resizes the help window to
`g:vertical_help_window_width` (79 by default).
2. `:H!` opens the help and close all the other windows.
